## About Me 🚀

I'm an enthusiastic and inquisitive **Indian 10th grader** who is delving into the field of **web development**. I like to build small projects, learn how things work, and investigate how ideas can be powered by code.

- 🌱 Currently learning: **React, Node.js, maths, data structures & algorithms**
- 🔭 Working on: *Small projects with JavaScript, HTML & CSS**
- 🌍 Languages: **English, Hindi**, and programming in **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**
- 📫 How to reach me: astik.ayushb@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy experimenting with code to mimic logic in the real world!
